find403.py and find400.py are both python files to search a specific word 
in a log file. 
find400.py is more improved code like:
- automatically handles file closing with Context Manager.
- reads the file line by line more simply and efficiently.
- catches file-related errors and displays meaningul messsages with Error Handling.
- you could later modify it to accept a keyword as input if needed.
